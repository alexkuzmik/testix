I was introduced to the concepts of Mock Objects by the Voodoo Mock testing tool by S. Matichin, which is also available under the GPL (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/voodoo-mock). I was curious as to how it worked, but was impatient trying to decipher code I had not written, and so set out to write a similar framework for myself.
